# DataWrangling_R
In these exercises I practice how to use functions mutate(), filter(), select(), and pipe operator %>% to manipulate data tables: 
* Change a data table by adding a new column, or changing an existing one
* Filter the data by subsetting rows
* Subset the data by selecting specific columns
* Use the pipe operator, %>% to perform a series of operations
